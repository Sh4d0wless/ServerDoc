<p><b>What does ServerDoc do?</b>
<br><b>-</b>ServerDoc will start a program and check the program is still
running every five seconds (default) and restart the program if required (if its
crashed or closed) on Win95/98/ME/200x/NT/XP & Linux systems. Windows NT users should read
<a href="modules.php?name=About_ServerDoc&amp;page=winnt.html"><u>this
note</u></a> and WinXP users should read
<a href="modules.php?name=About_ServerDoc&amp;page=winxp.html"><u>this note</u></a>. Linux control requires serverdoc running on a windows machine.
<br><b>-</b>ServerDoc can also run different commands with its internal scheduling.
You may want to run a game server between 6pm and 10pm or run different
game servers hourly/daily/weekly or monthly. Serverdoc can even be set
up to load a different mod/patch. You could have your servers set up to
run Normal DeathMatch one night, Team Fortress the next, Counterstrike
the night after. <BR>
<b>-</b>Serverdoc also has a remote interface to allow you (or clients) the ability to stop/start and change/edit the server command line. Remote clients can also be provided with access to edit files or only edit certian variables within a file.
<BR><b>-</b>Serverdoc can monitor private and maxplayer settings of a number of game servers and restart them if a client as violated these settings.

</p>
<p>A crashed server is no fun, and with serverdoc, it will be back up within
seconds.
<p>I have ServerDoc looking after my Quake 1, 2, 3 and Halflife Servers. (NOTE: I no longer run severs but continue work on serverdoc)
You will need the <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/vb60pro/Redist/sp5/WIN98Me/EN-US/vbrun60sp5.exe"><u>VB6
runtimes</u></a> if you dont already have them. :)
<p><b>Basic Usage</b> (not using SDcontrol, schedule or wwwconfig.cfg)
<br>Serverdoc.exe [gameserver command line]
<br>ie: <b>C:\serverdoc\Serverdoc.exe f:quakeqwsv +maxplayers 16</b>
<br> <br>Add your servers to your startup folder for automatic restarting of
servers after power failure/reboot.<p align="center">
