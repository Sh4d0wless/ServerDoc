You will need a valid serverdoc pro key to run this example.

In this example the command line is loaded from the "run" line in wwwconfig.cfg
HTTP port for remote access is started on port 4101 with user "myname" and password "mypass"
(Visit http://127.0.0.1:4101/ when serverdoc is running)

When the server is stopped remote clients can edit part of the command line. This example shows a dropdown 
selection for game type and input box for map. Radio input selection can also be used.

Other options such as Rcon_password can be changed using same system.
