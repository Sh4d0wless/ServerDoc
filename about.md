What does ServerDoc do?
-ServerDoc will start a program and check the program is still
running every five seconds (default) and restart the program if required (if its
crashed or closed) on Win95/98/ME/200x/NT/XP & Linux systems. Windows NT users should read
[this
note](modules.php?name=About_ServerDoc&page=winnt.html) and WinXP users should read
[this note](modules.php?name=About_ServerDoc&page=winxp.html). Linux control requires serverdoc running on a windows machine.
-ServerDoc can also run different commands with its internal scheduling.
You may want to run a game server between 6pm and 10pm or run different
game servers hourly/daily/weekly or monthly. Serverdoc can even be set
up to load a different mod/patch. You could have your servers set up to
run Normal DeathMatch one night, Team Fortress the next, Counterstrike
the night after. 
-Serverdoc also has a remote interface to allow you (or clients) the ability to stop/start and change/edit the server command line. Remote clients can also be provided with access to edit files or only edit certian variables within a file.
-Serverdoc can monitor private and maxplayer settings of a number of game servers and restart them if a client as violated these settings.


A crashed server is no fun, and with serverdoc, it will be back up within
seconds.
I have ServerDoc looking after my Quake 1, 2, 3 and Halflife Servers. (NOTE: I no longer run severs but continue work on serverdoc)
You will need the [VB6
runtimes](http://download.microsoft.com/download/vb60pro/Redist/sp5/WIN98Me/EN-US/vbrun60sp5.exe) if you dont already have them. :)
Basic Usage (not using SDcontrol, schedule or wwwconfig.cfg)
Serverdoc.exe [gameserver command line]
ie: C:\serverdoc\Serverdoc.exe f:quakeqwsv +maxplayers 16
 Add your servers to your startup folder for automatic restarting of
servers after power failure/reboot.
